.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBmmark\fP [\fBOPTIONS\fP] [\fIFILE...\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBMmark\fP is a powerful markdown processor written in Go, geared towards writing IETF documents. It
is, however, \fIalso\fP suited for writing complete books and other technical documentation.

.PP
Mmark provides an advanced markdown dialect that processes file(s) to produce internet-drafts in XML
RFC 7991
\[la]https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7991\[ra] format. Mmark can produce xml2rfc (aforementioned
RFC 7991), RFC 7749 (xml2rfc version 2), HTML5,  markdown and manual page (nroff) output.

.PP
The syntax is detailed at https://mmark.nl/syntax

.RE

.SH RFC 7749
.PP
This is currently the XML format used by the RFC editor for accepting Internet-Drafts. Some of these
turn into RFCs. For getting text output you'll need xml2rfc for the actual conversion.

.SH RFC 7991
.PP
This is the future XML format used by the RFC editor for accepting Internet-Drafts. A valid markdown
document can be turned in RFC 7749 or RFC 7991 XML.

.SH HTML5
.PP
The HTML5 renderer outputs HTML.

.SH MARKDOWN
.PP
Mmark can also be "translated" into markdown again. This is a useful feature for auto-formatting
markdown files.
