# Introduction

This RFC is a commentary on the difficulty of deciding upon an acceptably
distinctive hostname for one's computer, a problem which grows in direct
proportion to the logarithmically increasing size of the Internet.

Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Except to TS Eliot.

And, for that matter, to [@David Addison], who hates iambic pentameter.

# Credits

[@David Addison]

[@-libes; @-lottor; @-wong; @-ts]

# Security Considerations

Security issues are not discussed in this memo.

Particularly the cardiac security of certain famous poets.
